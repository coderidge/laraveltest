#Task A 

I've created a command, run this 'php artisan:command process'. 

Class Process.php is in app/Http/Helpers/Process.php 

With so much regex and string replacements it became messy, but would refactor the class
properly when more time is available. Not currently 100% correct. 

#Extension API 

* Would use a library like passport to secure the api 
* routing created for get, post, update, delete depending on requirements

# Task B 

* Install database geomiq.sql if not already installed, available base of project 

* Run php artisan serve to start server 

* The go to route /roles to view the users roles front end display.

I've created a rolesCommand which can be run, but would change the function for commandline
so not display a template.
